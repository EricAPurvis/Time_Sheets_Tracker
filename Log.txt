Current:
	JavaScript:
	changed all instances of var to let with the exception of array data.
	
	php:
	changed all array = array() to array = [];

	Html:
	changed all alert to inline alerts

	Concerns:
	The php query for username is not case sensitive, but the password is unless that a result of the md5 hashing prior to accessing the MySQL database.

Previously: All issues resolved. Everything should be as required and more from phase 1 and phase 2 specifications.
